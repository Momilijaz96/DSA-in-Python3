# DSA-in-Python3
This repo is a WIP that implements all famous data structures and algorithms required for technical interviews from "Cracking the Coding interview" by Gayle Laakmaan, in Python3.
Data Strucutres implemented so far:
1. Linked List
2. Hash Table with Chained Collision addressing
3. Stacks
4. Queues
5. Tree
6. Binary Tree


Algorithms implemented so far:
1. Depth First Search (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder) - Recursively 
2. Depth First Search (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder [with 1 and 2 stacks]) - Iteratively
3. Breath First Search - Iteratively using Queue
4.
